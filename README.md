This is a very similar version of the "Rust Crash Course | Rustlang" by Traversy Media on Youtube.

## Quick Start
Un-comment the desired function under main() to run. You also need to un-comment the imports (mod file_name).

``` bash
# Run With Cargo
cargo run

# Build
cargo build

# Build for production
cargo build --release
```
